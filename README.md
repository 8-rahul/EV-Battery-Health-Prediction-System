# ðŸ”‹ EV-Battery-Health-Prediction-System
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the State of Health (SoH) of EV batteries using machine learning. Users input real-time parametersâ€”cycle, temperature, voltage, and currentâ€”and receive an instant SoH prediction along with a visual trend. Designed for predictive maintenance and battery life monitoring in electric vehicles.

## ðŸ“Œ Objective :
To develop an AI-powered predictive maintenance system that accurately estimates the State of Health (SoH) of Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries using real-time input parameters such as cycle count, temperature, voltage, and current.

## ðŸš— Why This Matters :
EV battery degradation is a major concern for manufacturers and users alike. Predicting the SoH can:
- Enhance battery reliability and lifespan
  
- Reduce unexpected failures

- Support preventive maintenance schedules

- Optimize EV performance and safety

## ðŸ§  Tech Stack :
- Python: Core programming language

- Streamlit: For building the interactive web dashboard

- Scikit-learn: Machine learning model training

- Pandas / NumPy: Data manipulation

- Matplotlib / Seaborn: Visual analytics

- joblib: For saving/loading trained models

- VS Code: Development environment
